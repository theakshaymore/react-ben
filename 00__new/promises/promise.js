// Promise
// - it is an object, it is way to handle/manage asynchronous code in js compared to callbacks
// - avoids callback hell
// - states of promise
// -- pending - initial state
// -- fullfilled - operation susscessful
// -- rejected - operation failed
// -- prmise can be only change from pending to other state once - pending -> fulfilled or pending -> rejected - only once
